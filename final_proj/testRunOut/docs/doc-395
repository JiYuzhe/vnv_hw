feature  windows  the  group  box  window  class  uses  the  hredraw  and  vredraw  style  bits  force  full  redraw  the  control  and  all  children  when  resized  this  causes  flashing  the  fix  register  new  window  class  without  these  bits  and  implement  special  code  that  damages  only  the  exposed  area  feature  win  certain  devices  defining  new  window  class  which  looks  like  button  causes create window  crash  the  workaround  use  the  class  button  directly

feature  windows  when  the  user  clicks  the  group  box  label  the  group  box  takes  focus  this  unwanted  the  fix  avoid  calling  the  group  box  window  proc
even  though  legal  create  this  widget  with  scroll  bars  they  serve  useful  purpose  because  they  not  automatically  scroll  the  widget  client  area  the  fix  clear  the  swt  style
the  group  has  text  and  the  text  wider  than  the  client  area  pad  the  width  the  text  not  clipped
returns  the  receiver  text  which  the  string  that  the  used  the  title  the  text  has  not  previously  been  set  returns  empty  string  return  the  text  exception swt exception  error  widget  disposed  the  receiver  has  been  disposed  error  thread  invalid  access  not  called  from  the  thread  that  created  the  receiver 
sets  the  receiver  text  which  the  string  that  will  displayed  the  receiver  title  the  argument  which  may  not  null  the  string  may  include  the  mnemonic  character  mnemonics  are  indicated  amp  that  causes  the  next  character  the  mnemonic  when  the  user  presses  key  sequence  that  matches  the  mnemonic  focus  assgned  the  first  child  the  group  most  platforms  the  mnemonic  appears  underlined  but  may  emphasised  platform  specific  manner  the  mnemonic  indicator  character  amp  can  escaped  doubling  the  string  causing  single  amp  displayed  param  string  the  new  text  exception illegal argument exception  error  null  argument  the  text  null  exception swt exception  error  widget  disposed  the  receiver  has  been  disposed  error  thread  invalid  access  not  called  from  the  thread  that  created  the  receiver 
bug  windows  when  get  called  with  dcx  intersectupdate  the  hdc  that  returned  does  not  include  the  current  update  region  this  was  confirmed  under  debug  windows  when  get  complained  about  invalid  flags  therefore  not  easily  possible  get  hdc  from  outside  paint  that  includes  the  current  damage  and  clips  children  because  the  receiver  has  children  and  draws  frame  and  label  necessary  that  the  receiver  always  draw  clipped  the  current  damaged  area  the  fix  force  the  receiver  fully  clipped  including  clipchildren  and  clipsiblings  the  default  style  bits
feaure  windows  group  boxes  not  erase  the  background  before  drawing  the  fix  fill  the  background  note  this  work  around  causes  flashing  and  not  necessary  when  parent  has  theme
feature  windows  the  window  proc  for  the  group  box  returns  httransparent  indicating  that  mouse  messages  should  not  delivered  the  receiver  and  any  children  normally  group  boxes  windows  not  have  children  and  this  the  correct  behavior  for  this  case  because  allow  children  answer  htclient  allow  mouse  messages  delivered  the  children
feature  windows  version  comctl  dll  every  time  the  mouse  moves  the  group  title  redraws  this  only  happens  when  nchittest  returns  htclient  the  fix  avoid  calling  the  group  window  proc
feature  windows  version  comctl  dll  when  printclient  sent  from  child  group  control  parent  group  the  parent  group  clears  the  font  from  the  hdc  normally  group  boxes  windows  not  have  children  this  behavior  undefined  when  the  parent  group  not  group  there  problem  the  fix  save  and  restore  the  current  font
