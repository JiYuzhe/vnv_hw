return  the  number  lines  should  answer  when  text  specified  the styled text  widget  relies  this  behavior  for  drawing  the  cursor  return  the  number  lines  for  example  text  value get line count  null

replace  the  text  with new text  starting  position  start  for  length replace length  implementors  have  notify  the text change listeners  that  were  added  using  code add text change listener  code  before  and  after  the  content  changed  code text changing event  code  has  sent  the text changing  method  before  the  content  changed  and  code text changed event  code  has  sent  the text changed  method  after  the  content  has  changed  the  text  change  that  occurs  after  the  code text changing event  code  has  been  sent  has  consistent  with  the  data  provided  the  code text changing event  code  this  data  will  cached  the  widget  and  will  used  when  the  code text changed event  code  received  the  code text changing event  code  should  set  follows  event  start  start  the  replaced  text  event new text  text  that  going  inserted  empty  string  text  will  inserted  event replace char count  length  text  that  going  replaced  event new char count  length  text  that  going  inserted  event replace line count  number  lines  that  are  going  replaced  event new line count  number  new  lines  that  are  going  inserted  note new line count  the  number  inserted  lines  and replace line count  the  number  deleted  lines  based  the  change  that  occurs  visually  for  example replace text new text replace line count new line count  param  start  start  offset  text  replace  none  the  offsets  include  delimiters  preceeding  lines  offset  the  first  character  the  document  param replace length  length  text  replace  param  text  text  replace  see text change listener
