this  class  provides  bridge  between  swt  and  awt  that  possible  embedded  awt  components  swt  and  vice  versa  since 
the  name  the  embedded  frame  class  the  default  class  name  for  the  platform  will  used  code  null  code
note  that  the  jawt  library  loaded  explicitily  because  cannot  found  the  library  loader  all  exceptions  are  caught  because  the  library  may  have  been  loaded  already
initialize  the  default  focus  traversal  policy
creates  new  code  java  awt  frame  code  this  frame  the  root  for  the  awt  components  that  will  embedded  within  the  composite  order  for  the  embedding  succeed  the  composite  must  have  been  created  with  the  swt  embedded  style  important  jdk  the  embedded  frame  does  not  receive  mouse  events  when  lightweight  component  added  child  the  embedded  frame  the  cursor  does  not  change  order  work  around  both  these  problems  strongly  recommended  that  heavyweight  component  such  code  java  awt  panel  code  added  the  frame  the  root  all  components  param  parent  the  parent  code  composite  code  the  new  code  java  awt  frame  code  return  code  java  awt  frame  code  the  parent  the  embedded  awt  components  exception illegal argument exception  error  null  argument  the  parent  null  error  invalid  argument  the  parent  composite  does  not  have  the  swt  embedded  style  since 
some  have  implemented  the  embedded  frame  constructor  take  integer  and  other  take  long  handle  this  binary  incompatability  use  reflection  create  the  embedded  frame
this  necessary  make  lightweight  components  directly  added  the  frame  receive  mouse  events  properly
generate  the  appropriate  events  activate  and  deactivate  the  embedded  frame  this  needed  order  make  keyboard  focus  work  properly  for  lightweights
temporary  code  for  some  reason  the  graphics  configuration  the  embedded  frame  not  initialized  properly  this  causes  exception  when  the  depth  the  screen  changed
creates  new  code  shell  code  this  shell  the  root  for  the  swt  widgets  that  will  embedded  within  the  awt  canvas  param  display  the  display  for  the  new  shell  param  parent  the  parent  code  java  awt  canvas  code  the  new  shell  return  code  shell  code  the  parent  the  embedded  swt  widgets  exception illegal argument exception  error  null  argument  the  display  null  error  null  argument  the  parent  null  error  invalid  argument  the  parent  peer  not  created  since
