classes  that  implement  this  interface  provide  methods  that  deal  with  the  events  that  are  generated  when  accessibility  client  sends  message  control  after  creating  instance  class  that  implements  this  interface  can  added  control  using  the  code add accessible control listener  code  method  and  removed  using  the  code remove accessible control listener  code  method  when  client  requests  information  the  appropriate  method  will  invoked  note  accessibility  clients  use  child  identifiers  specify  whether  they  want  information  about  control  one  its  children  child  identifiers  are  increasing  integers  beginning  with  the  identifier  childid  self  represents  the  control  itself  note  this  interface  typically  used  implementors  custom  control  provide  very  detailed  information  about  the  control  instance  accessibility  clients  see accessible control adapter  see accessible control event  since
