use  overlapped  for  all  windows  either  dialog  top  level  that create window  will  respect  usedefault  and  set  the  default  window  location  and  size  note  when  overlapped  window  created  windows  gives  the  new  window  caption  style  bits  these  two  constants  are  follows  overlapped  caption  border  dlgframe
note  this  does  not  work  when  get  activate  prior  adding  listener
restore  sip  state  when  window  activated

get  the  current  location  the  cursor  not  the  location  the  cursor  when  the  mouseactivate  was  generated  this  strictly  incorrect  but  necessary  order  support  activate  and  deactivate  events  for  embedded  widgets  that  have  their  own  event  loop  that  case  the  cursor  location  reported get message pos  the  one  for  our  event  loop  not  the  embedded  widget  event  loop
when  shell  created  with  swt  top  and  swt  focus  not  activate  the  shell  when  the  user  clicks  the  the  client  area  the  border  control  within  the  shell  that  does  not  take  focus
