instances  this  class  are  used  define  the  edges  control  within  code form layout  code  code form attachments  code  are  set  into  the  top  bottom  left  and  right  fields  the  code form data  code  for  control  for  example  pre form data  data  new form data  data  top  new form attachment  data  bottom  new form attachment  100  data  left  new form attachment  data  right  new form attachment  100  button set layout data  data  pre  code form attachment  code  defines  where  attach  the  side  control  using  the  equation  the  term  represents  fraction  the  parent  composite  width  from  the  left  height  from  the  top  can  defined  using  numerator  and  denominator  just  percentage  value  percentage  used  the  denominator  set  100  the  term  the  equation  represents  offset  pixels  from  the  attachment  position  for  example  pre form attachment  attach  new form attachment  pre  specifies  that  the  side  which  the  code form attachment  code  object  belongs  will  lie  the  parent  composite  minus  pixels  control  sides  can  also  attached  another  control  for  example  pre form attachment  attach  new form attachment  button  pre  specifies  that  the  side  which  the  code form attachment  code  object  belongs  will  lie  the  same  position  the  adjacent  side  the  code  button  code  control  plus  pixels  the  control  side  can  also  attached  the  opposite  side  the  specified  control  for  example  pre form data  data  new form data  data  left  new form attachment  button  swt  left  pre  specifies  that  the  left  side  the  control  will  lie  the  same  position  the  left  side  the  code  button  code  control  the  control  can  also  attached  position  that  will  center  the  control  the  specified  control  for  example  pre  data  left  new form attachment  button  swt  center  pre  specifies  that  the  left  side  the  control  will  positioned  that  centered  between  the  left  and  right  sides  the  code  button  code  control  the  alignment  not  specified  the  default  attach  the  adjacent  side  see form layout  see form data  since 
numerator  specifies  the  numerator  the  term  the  equation  which  defines  the  attachment
denominator  specifies  the  denominator  the  term  the  equation  which  defines  the  attachment  the  default  value  100
offset  specifies  the  offset  pixels  the  control  side  from  the  attachment  position  the  offset  positive  then  the  control  side  offset  the  right  below  the  attachment  position  negative  then  the  control  side  offset  the  left  above  the  attachment  position  this  equivalent  the  term  the  equation  the  default  value 
control  specifies  the  control  which  the  control  side  attached
alignment  specifies  the  alignment  the  control  side  that  attached  control  for  top  and  bottom  attachments  top  bottom  and  center  are  used  for  left  and  right  attachments  left  right  and  center  are  used  any  other  case  occurs  the  default  will  used  instead  possible  values  are  top  attach  the  side  the  top  side  the  specified  control  bottom  attach  the  side  the  bottom  side  the  specified  control  left  attach  the  side  the  left  side  the  specified  control  right  attach  the  side  the  right  side  the  specified  control  center  attach  the  side  position  which  will  center  the  control  the  specified  control  default  attach  the  side  the  adjacent  side  the  specified  control
