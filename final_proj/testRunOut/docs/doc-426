feature  win  ppc  minimizebox  maximizebox  are  not  supposed  used  they  are  the  result  button  which  does  not  repaint  correctly  the  fix  remove  this  style
either  minimizebox  maximizebox  are  set  must  also  set  sysmenu  the  buttons  will  not  appear
both  sysmenu  and  caption  must  set  order  for  the  system  menu  appear
bug  windows  the  caption  style  must  set  when  the  window  resizable  does  not  draw  properly
this  code  intentionally  commented  seems  that  this  problem  originally  windows  has  been  fixed  later  versions  because  the  exact  nature  the  drawing  problem  unknown  keep  the  commented  code  around  case  comes  back
style  swt  resize  style  swt  title
  nothing
get  the  size  the  trimmings
get  the  size  the  scroll  bars
get  the  height  the  menu  bar
note  win  ppc  close  the  shell  when  user  taps  ctrl  idok  represents  the  done  button  which  also  closes  the  shell
icons  need  black  pixels  where  the  mask  transparent
note  the command bar  part  the  client  area  not  the  trim  applications  don  expect  this  subtract  the  height  the command bar
feature  windows  for  some  reason  nccalcsize  does  not  compute  the  client  area  when  the  window  minimized  the  fix  compute  using adjust window rect  and get system metrics  note  this  code  fails  compute  the  correct  client  area  for  minimized  window  where  the  menu  bar  would  wrap  were  the  window  restored  there  fix  for  this  problem  this  time
