ensure  that  the  orientation  the  tool  tip  matches  the  orientation  the  control
set  the  clipping  bits
paint  the  control  and  the  background
get  the  damage
create  the  paint 
send  the  paint  event
possible  but  unlikely  that  application  code  could  have  disposed  the  widget  the  paint  event  this  happens  attempt  give  back  the  paint  anyways  because  this  scarce  windows  resource
widget  could  disposed  this  point
dispose  the  paint 
restore  the  clipping  bits
possible  but  unlikely  that  application  code  could  have  disposed  the  widget  the  paint  event  this  happens  don  attempt  restore  the  style
begin  deferred  window  positioning
