feature  windows  the  progress  bar  does  not  implement  getdlgcode  result  progress  bar  takes  focus  and  takes  part  tab  traversal  this  behavior  while  unspecified  unwanted  the  fix  implement  getdlgcode  behave  like  static  control
feature  windows  when  progress  bar  with  the  style  pbs  marquee  becomes  too  small  the  animation  currently  small  bar  moving  from  right  left  does  not  have  enough  space  draw  the  result  that  the  progress  bar  does  not  appear  moving  the  fix  detect  this  case  clear  the  pbs  marquee  style  and  emulate  the  animation  using  pbm  stepit  note  this  only  happens  window
